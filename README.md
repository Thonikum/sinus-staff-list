## **📑 Overview**

This is a script for the [SinusBot]. It will automatically keep track of predefined staff members going online and offline to display this information in a specific channel description.

There are a lot of options to customize the look of the description such as the default BB script to format text like in [TeamSpeak].

The script features listing usernames as hyperlinks so they are actually clickable in the channel description.

Additionally they are sorted automatically by online and offline and alphabetically.
